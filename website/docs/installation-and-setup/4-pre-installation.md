| **Clean** Skyrim in **ENGLISH** language installed in non-protected folder | :white_check_mark: | <ul><li>Before you do anything with _Wabbajack,_ ensure that _Skyrim_ is installed in a non-protected folder (for examle, the root of your drive is a good non-protected folder, like `D:\`). It **cannot** be located in `Program Files` _(that's a protected folder!)_ or the list would not function. Relocate the game if necessary. [Here's the Steam guide](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/4BD4-4528-6B2E-8327) on moving games to another folder/drive.</li> <li>[Here's a Bethesda's guide](https://help.bethesda.net/#en/answer/31431) on how to set the game to English.</li></ul> |
| [Skyrim AE paid `$20` upgrade](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1746860/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim_Anniversary_Upgrade/) | :white_check_mark: | This is **required** for the modlist to work, no exceptions! Regular `Special Edition` or free `CC` content **won't do**. |

| [Nexus Account](https://users.nexusmods.com/register) | :white_check_mark: | Basic Nexus account is **mandatory**; it **must** be created before continuing. |
| [Nexus Premium](https://next.nexusmods.com/premium) | :x: | Nexus Premium is **strongly** recommended or the installation would take many more hours _(possibly days)_. |

| [Visual Studio 2015, 2017, 2019 and 2022](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe) | :white_check_mark: | **Required** for Mod Organizer 2 and a few mods. |
| `600 GB` of free space on SSD | :white_check_mark: | After the installation our list + downloads would take up around `450 GB` *(downloads folder can be deleted or relocated after installation, it would free you around `150 GB`)*, but the whole installation process would require up to `600 GB` to store its temp files and caches. |
| Disabled/removed **OneDrive** | :white_check_mark: | Ensure that _OneDrive_ is **uninstalled** or **completely disabled.** This program locks some of _Skyrim_'s configuration files when in use and would cause the modlist to experience errors. |
| **Pagefile** set to `40 GB` | :white_check_mark: | You must set your Advanced Memory Pagefile to at least 40GB or the modlist would constantly crash. On _Windows 11_ you can find this setting in the `About` page for your PC. [Here](https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/windows-11/how-to-manage-virtual-memory-on-windows-11) is an instruction manual to find this specific option; other versions of Windows are mostly similar. Setting the minimum and maximum pagefile size to `40,960` on one Solid State Drive is recommended. |
