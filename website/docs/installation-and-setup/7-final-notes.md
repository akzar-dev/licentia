## :tiger2: **Survival mode**

    When you reach your first exterior world location, you will be prompted to enable `Survival Mode`. This mod **disables fast travel** and **requires eating, sleeping, and staying warm to survive**. The option can be changed later in the default `Gameplay` settings of Skyrim.

## :pray: **Diety**

    You will also receive a prompt about which **Divine** and/or **Daedra** you wish to worship, depending on your race. Choose according to your preference _(or don't choose any)_.

## :computer: **Controls bindings**

    **Controls map** with nice graphics can be viewed by pressing `F11` in-game _(suggested and mapped by our amazing team member [CatastrophicApathy](https://github.com/KMan9454))_

## :video_game: **Playing with the contriller**

    **Want to play with a controller?** &mdash; read [this amazing Controller guide](/guides/controller) also written by [CatastrophicApathy](https://github.com/KMan9454)
