# ![Modlist user agreement](./img/2-modlist-user-agreement.png)

---

This is some sort of an agreement of the parties, them being **us** *(Licentia Team)* and **you** *(the user)*. 

Before you embark on your exciting _Wabbajack_ NSFW journey, **please read it** to understand _what_ you're getting into 👷

1. **This is a modlist, not a professionally made game**

   - Please keep in mind that _Licentia NEXT_ is constant works in progress, an absolute amateur effort to harmonize the work of dozens if not hundreds of amateur mod authors who have little interest in verifying that their creations work in every possible setup.

   - You should **NEVER** expect a 100% polished, well-balanced and "perfect" experience.

---

2. **Do your research!**

   - As a Modlist User, we expect some small efforts into fixing your own issues, mostly by searching the documentation provided here and by the Discord channels. It's very likely any issue you encounter has already been solved &mdash; please, do your research!

   - **HOWEVER** if your issue is a rock slightly out of place, a particle of dust that looks weird or a patch of a bum showing through some clothing &mdash; please don't expect it to be fixed ASAP **(or maybe ever)**.

   - We're all modding a nearly 10 year old game here which already has a legendary reputation for _bugginess_, so please temper your expectations. 
      > It just works 🤷

3. **Support shouldn't assumed to be instant or obligatory**

   - I work a full-time job IRL and *most* of our Team Members have real lives as well *(shocker, I know)*.

   - It's a volunteer effort, so please, understand that support should not be expected or demanded &mdash; sometimes you could figure it out yourself with just a little reading,  and sometimes we might not have an answer for you. 

   - That being said, you're more than welcome to ask for it in a civil way, we'd try our best to help you :open_hands:

---

4. Finally, the **MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU CAN DO &mdash; ABSOLUTELY** with **ANY** NSFW Wabbajack modlist is to **TAKE CARE OF YOUR SAVE!**

   - Avoid saving frequently, during combat, or continuously reload when you die &mdash; Skyrim should be approached as the ramshackle conglomeration of barely functioning hobby projects that it is. 

   - If you **DO NOT TAKE CARE OF YOUR SAVE** and try to force it, **EVERYTHING WILL BREAK** and you will experience all kinds of bugs that can't be solved.

   - _It is generally recommended to save the game no more frequently than every five minutes, during periods of "low activity"_ &mdash; no NSFW scenes, no combat, no huge events going on. If you can **FOLLOW THIS ONE PRIMARY DIRECTIVE** &mdash; you will probably have a good experience. If you can't, you won't.
